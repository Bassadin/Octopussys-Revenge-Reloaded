Hello Guys!

This is my GitHub repo of Octopussy's Revenge Reloaded, my remake of "Octopussy's Revenge" which you probably know.
It's a very simple and basic 2D-Arcade shooter, a bit like Space Invaders, but from the left to the right.
In this remake I will share everything I do with you so especially the ones new to LÖVE can follow me.

You can also watch my Videos on YouTube (http://www.youtube.com/DestructiveRealityDE) but they are in german ;)

The reason because I'm writing english here is that everyone can understand it and if you want to program, you have to know english good anyway.

Have fun with this repo,

Bastian Hodapp alias VADS, Destructive Reality
